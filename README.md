#Shape Area Calculator

#Overview

This is a C# console application that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Inheritance. The program allows the user to select a shape (Circle, Rectangle, or Triangle), input the relevant dimensions (such as radius, length, width, base, and height), and then calculate and display the area of the selected shape.
